# Python Ciphers Implemntation

This program is a benchmarking program to benchmark various classical and modern cryptographic algorithms like Affine cipher, Column cipher and Playfair cipher. Moreover, this program also benchmarks AES with the CBC mode of operation
All these algorithms are implemented purely using python's native built in libraries 

## Algoritms

These are the algorithms to be implemented in the script

- Affine Cypher
- Columnuar Transposition Cipher
- PlayFair Cipher
- Advanced Encryption Standard with the CBC mode of operation
