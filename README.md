# PythonCiphersImplemntation
This program is a benchmarking program to benchmark various classical and modern cryptographic algorithms like Affine cipher, Column cipher and Playfair cipher. Moreover, this program also benchmarks AES with teh CBC mode of operation
All these algorithms are implemented purely using python's native built in libraries
